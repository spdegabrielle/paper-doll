In case it's of interest, enclosed is some code extracted from one of
my talks. Start by running "demo.rkt".

Someone might be interested to play with it or turn it into something
better. Since there is no documentation, that someone would have to
read the code to extract the various acceptable values for arguments.
The most obvious direction for improvement is that choices like hair
style and color should have been separated into different arguments.
